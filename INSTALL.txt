To boot BITS, you need to create a bootable BITS disk.  You can construct this
disk in one of two ways, depending on how you want to use the resulting disk:

- This distribution includes a pre-built .iso image, which you can burn to a CD
  or image onto a USB disk to produce a bootable BITS disk.  This option lets
  you create bootable BITS media more quickly and easily, but does not allow
  you to modify the disk after creating it.  For more information, refer to the
  section "Using the pre-constructed read-only BITS disk image".

- If you want to add or edit files in the BITS distribution, upgrade your
  disk to subsequent versions of BITS more easily, or use a USB disk to store
  data other than BITS, then you can use the "boot" and optionally "efi"
  directories in this distribution to construct a bootable USB disk which
  supports subsequent modification.  For this procedure, refer to the section
  "Constructing a bootable BITS USB disk supporting subsequent modification".


Using the pre-constructed read-only BITS disk image
===================================================

This distribution includes a pre-built .iso image.  You can burn this image onto
a CD using any standard CD burning software for your platform.  Please note that
you need to burn the .iso as an image; you should end up with a CD containing
directories named "boot" and "efi", not a CD containing the .iso file.

Thanks to deep magic provided by GRUB, the same .iso file also works as a
bootable USB disk image.  If you image the .iso file directly to a USB disk (the
whole disk, not a partition), you'll end up with a bootable USB disk.  On Linux,
try "dd if=bits-NNN.iso of=/dev/sdX"; replace bits-NNN.iso with the versioned
BITS iso, and sdX with your disk device, and remember to umount it first.  On
Windows, you might try "dd for Windows".  In both cases, make sure you refer to
the correct disk device for your USB disk, not your system's hard disk.  Note
that this procedure will overwrite any data on your USB disk.  Also note that
this constructs a USB disk containing an ISO9660 filesystem as a partition,
which operating systems do not normally expect to see; you might have some
trouble reading it from within your OS, and you definitely cannot write to it.

If you want to try out BITS within a virtual machine, you can tell your VM to
use the .iso file either as a disk image or a CD image.  For KVM, you can run
"kvm -cdrom bits-NNN.iso" to boot BITS via CD.  Note that most hardware-specific
tests will not run in a virtual machine, but some of the general tests will
work.  If you find out interesting things about either BITS or your VM in the
process, we'd love to hear about it.


Constructing a bootable BITS USB disk supporting subsequent modification
========================================================================

This procedure creates a bootable USB disk.  You will need a USB disk with a
reasonable amount of space (enough to hold the boot directory present in this
distribution, plus a little slack space).  Your USB disk should have a FAT32
partition.

If your USB disk contains any data that you care about, back it up now.  No
really.  There will be a test later.

Note that if you have previously followed this procedure to create a bootable
BITS USB disk, you can upgrade to a new version of BITS by deleting the "boot"
directory from the root of the USB disk and copying the "boot" directory from
this BITS .zip distribution to the root of the USB disk.  You must delete the
old directory first; copying the new directory over the old will not remove
obsolete files, and will thus break in subtle ways.  If this procedure works for
you, you don't need to follow the remaining steps in this section; if you need
to construct a new BITS USB disk, read on.

Make sure you know the correct device name for your USB disk, so you don't
write to your system's hard disk instead.

Go get syslinux from <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/>, or
install the package provided by your Linux distribution; download the latest
version and extract it somewhere you can find from the command line.  The
syslinux distribution includes binaries for various platforms, including Linux,
Windows, and DOS.

The remaining instructions will require a command prompt; open one, and cd to
this directory (containing this INSTALL.txt file and the boot directory).
Under Windows, when the commands below refer to a program, you will need to
give the path to the executable, wherever you extracted it.

To build a bootable USB disk, you will need a USB disk with a FAT32 partition.
A partitionless USB disk with no partition table and a FAT32 filesystem
directly on the disk, sometimes called a "superfloppy", will *not* work.  If
you have such a disk, you must partition it so that it has a partition table
and a FAT32 partition.  For Linux, try gparted.  For Windows, the "HP USB disk
storage format tool" can do this; you can find that tool at
<http://downloads.pcworld.com/pub/new/utilities/peripherals/SP27608.exe>.  Run
it, choose your USB disk (the tool should not let you choose your system hard
disk), and choose "FAT32".  The volume label does not matter.  Do not check
"Create a DOS startup disk"; this procedure will make the disk bootable, but it
will boot something *much* more awesome than DOS.

Now, copy the "boot" and "efi" directories to the root of that drive.

For Windows, run:
xcopy /s boot u:\boot\
xcopy /s efi u:\efi\
Change "u:" to the drive letter of your USB disk.

For Linux, run:
cp -r boot efi /media/disk/
Change /media/disk to the mount point of your USB disk.

Now, you need to make the disk bootable with syslinux.

For Windows, run:
syslinux.exe -m -a u:
Change "syslinux.exe" to the path to the syslinux executable for your platform,
and "u:" to the drive letter of your USB disk

For Linux, run:
syslinux /dev/sdb1
Change "/dev/sdb1" to the device name of the partition on your USB disk.  Take
care not to syslinux your system hard disk.  You will also need to set the boot
flag on the partition containing BITS; gparted can do that.  Finally, you need
to install an MBR that will boot the bootable partition; the syslinux package
includes an "mbr.bin" which will work.  To install that MBR to the USB disk,
run: cat /usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin > /dev/sdb
Change /dev/sdb to the device name of your USB disk,  Note that your syslinux
distribution may install mbr.bin somewhere else.

The resulting disk will boot via USB on systems booting via MBR or via the
compatibility support module (CSM) of an EFI BIOS.  It will also boot
natively on many 32-bit and 64-bit EFI BIOSes; however, some EFI BIOSes may
require the partition containing the "efi" directory to have partition type
0xef rather than one of the usual FAT32 types such as 0x0c.  If you have such
an EFI BIOS, you may need to change the type of the partition to 0xef before
your BIOS will boot from it; note that this will also prevent Windows from
assigning a drive letter to that partition by default.

See README.txt in the boot directory of the newly created bootable disk for
more information on BITS.
