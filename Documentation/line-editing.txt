Python line-editing keybindings

The Python interactive interpreter (launched via the "python" command)
supports line editing via a custom readline implementation written in Python,
in python/readline.py.  It aims to support the most common keybindings and
functionality provided by GRUB's line editing and by readline on a standard
Linux system.  By design, it does not support the full configurability of
readline.  However, if you find a feature missing that your fingers rely on,
feel free to report it.

All printable characters insert themselves; other keys work as follows:

Enter:
Submit the line, from anywhere on the line.

Delete:
Delete the character to the right of the cursor.

Backspace or Ctrl-H:
Delete the character to the left of the cursor.

Tab or Ctrl-I:
Tab-completion, attempt to complete the property name to the left of the
cursor, as a property of the expression further to the left of the cursor.
Note that this will evaluate part of the current command line as part of
completion.

Home or Ctrl-A:
Move cursor to the beginning of the line.

End or Ctrl-E:
Move cursor to the end of the line.

Left or Ctrl-B:
Move cursor left by one character.

Right or Ctrl-F:
Move cursor right by one character.

Ctrl-Left:
Move cursor left by one word (sequence of alphanumeric characters).

Ctrl-Right:
Move cursor right by one word (sequence of alphanumeric characters).

Up or Ctrl-P:
Show the previous line in history.

Down or Ctrl-N:
Show the next line in history.

Ctrl-D:
On an empty line, acts as end of file.  At the main Python prompt, this will
exit the interactive interpreter.

Ctrl-K:
Delete ("Kill") from the cursor to the end of the line.  Stores the text in
the kill ring; see Ctrl-Y for details.

Ctrl-L:
Clear the screen.

Ctrl-O:
Submit the line, and at the next prompt, load the next line from history.
This makes it easy to re-run multi-line commands.  Note that since the Python
interactive interpreter requires a blank line after a multi-line block, the
history will remember blank lines (though not multiple consecutive blank
lines).

Ctrl-U:
Delete from the cursor to the beginning of the line.  Stores the text in the
kill ring; see Ctrl-Y for details.

Ctrl-W:
Delete the previous word (back to the previous whitespace character).  Stores
the text in the kill ring; see Ctrl-Y for details.

Ctrl-Y:
Insert the most recently killed text (the top of the "kill ring") into the
line at the current cursor position ("yank").  Keys that kill text (Ctrl-K,
Ctrl-U, Ctrl-W) store that text at the top of the "kill ring"; repeated use of
those keys with no intervening keys will accumulate more text into that same
entry in the kill ring.

Alt-Y:
Immediately after a Ctrl-Y or Alt-Y, rotate the kill ring, and replace the
previously yanked text with the new top of the kill ring.

Ctrl-Z:
On an empty line, acts as end of file.  At the main Python prompt, this will
exit the interactive interpreter.  For compatibility with Windows-trained
fingers.

Escape:
On an empty line, acts as end of file.  At the main Python prompt, this will
exit the interactive interpreter.  For compatibility with systems that don't
support inputting Ctrl-D or other Ctrl-characters.
