bits-1219
=========

BITS now builds via a Makefile rather than a shell script.  This allows
the build to run in parallel, significantly speeding up builds.

Note that unlike the build script, which autodetected the number of CPUs
to build on, the Makefile uses the usual -j option to make.  So, if
you're used to ./build autodetecting your CPUs, you'll want to use make
-j$(nproc) (or just directly specify your desired amount of parallelism,
as you do with other makefiles).

Use make V=1 to let make echo commands before it runs them.

Use make LOCAL=1 to include local-files in the build (formerly ./build
local).

BITS now builds within a "build" subdirectory of the source rather than
a temporary directory under /tmp.  The build system no longer removes
this directory as part of the build, only via an explicit "make clean",
to make it easier to investigate the build results.

Note that despite building via Make, BITS does *not* attempt to support
incremental builds.  We continue to recommend ccache to speed up rebuilds.

Notable new features:

- Add a menu entry to exit back to EFI.

- Show on the main menu how BITS was booted: 32-bit BIOS, 32-bit EFI, or
  64-bit EFI.

- Support reading and writing control registers.

  bits.read_cr(apicid, n) reads CRn.

  bits.write_cr(apicid, n, value) writes value to CRn.

  Both functions return None on GPF.

Various improvements to the pager:

- When showing output from Python code via the pager, capture tracebacks
  and display those via the pager as well, so that they wait for input.
  Previously, if an exception occurred, it would flash on the screen
  briefly before returning directly to the menu, requiring a trip to the
  log to view the traceback.

  Also display the output produced before the exception.

- Don't suggest going up when at the top of the output.

- Mention Up as well as PgUp.

- Clean up and simplify logic for EFI file handling and for displaying
  available options.

Migrate quite a bit of code from C to Python:

- efi: Remove efi.call and the underlying _efi methods supporting it

  Now that we can call EFI functions via ctypes, we don't need efi.call
  anymore.

- Remove bits.malloc and bits.memmove, now unused with the move to ctypes

- acpi: Use ctypes to call most ACPICA functions from Python, rather
  than wrapping them via the Python C API.

  This allows replacing several C functions with simpler Python
  equivalents.

  Because the 32-bit BIOS port uses a calling convention unsupported by
  libffi, introduce various trivial C wrappers that re-export ACPICA
  functions with the standard C calling convention.  For
  AcpiWalkNamespace, introduce a more detailed wrapper that handles
  callbacks back into Python-provided functions.

  Export acpica_init to Python as well, and call it before calling the
  ACPICA functions.

- acpi: Move unsafe_io handling from C to Python.

  Directly export the address of the variable and manipulate it using
  ctypes.

- acpi: Add acpi.install_interface, wrapping AcpiInstallInterface, for
  use in the ACPI OS features menu.

- acpi: Add an exception mechanism with error code names, and a function
  to transform an ACPI_STATUS value into an exception.  This uses
  AcpiFormatException to decode error codes.

- acpi: Add docstrings to ACPICA functions

Migrate quite a bit of code from GRUB scripting (and supporting C and
Python scaffolding) to Python:

- Convert MWAIT latency test to Python, with a minimal C helper for the
  timing-sensitive portion.

  Delete the now-unused "timer" and "cpu_ping" commands.

- Port mwait menu to Python

- Drop code to force specific configuration profiles on Nehalem and
  Sandy Bridge.

  This code remains available in older releases, but drop it from the
  current version rather than porting it from GRUB configuration
  language to Python.

- configure.cfg: Drop support for CPU-specific GRUB configure menu
  files, since no more such files remain.

- Factor out a bits.brandstring() function to return the brandstring.

- Generate the CPU name on the main menu using Python, and improve title
  to use CPU brandstring rather than maintaining a table of CPU
  marketing names in BITS.

- Delete CPU family names and marketing names.

- Drop GRUB-based CPU detection entirely.

  None of the GRUB config files depend on the variables this sets
  anymore; all CPU-specific code lives in Python now.

- Remove the testsuite module and C expression evaluator.

  The GRUB CPU detection code was the last user of this.

- Remove options to GRUB commands to run on particular CPUs.

  The GRUB CPU detection code was the last programmatic user of this, and
  command-line users can use Python for this.

- Remove all GRUB commands and options not used manually.

  Nothing uses these commands programmatically anymore, so drop mechanisms
  to write to environment variables, operate quietly, run tests, format
  environment variables for display, sleep, or set mwait.

  A future version of BITS may remove the remaining commands entirely,
  in favor of Python functions, as the Python functions become
  increasingly high-level and convenient.  If you still rely on the GRUB
  commands, please contact us.

Migrating all this code from C and GRUB to Python allowed deleting over 9000
lines of code in BITS relative to the previous release.

Other changes in this release:

- Remove the runppm command to load and run power-management reference
  code; this is no longer used with current CPUs.

- README.Developers.txt: Update for the switch to build with make.

- README.Developers.txt: Update reference to GRUB version information.

- README.Developers.txt: BITS doesn't need the todos command anymore.

- acpi: Fix reinitialization after termination.  Clear all of the
  initialization flags, so that reinitialization actually loads tables
  rather than failing.  This fixes the menu items to change what OS
  features BITS advertises to ACPI.

- acpi: Don't retrieve full table data just to check if a table exists.
  get_table and get_table_addr both return None for a nonexistent table,
  but the former returns a string containing the full table data, while
  the latter just returns the address.

- acpi: Drop support for AcpiGbl_EnableAmlDebugObject.  Our current
  setting for AcpiDbgLevel leaves the debug object always enabled
  regardless of this value, so drop it.

- acpi: Add assert that the number of ACPI_OBJECT_TYPE values hasn't
  changed

- acpi: Use "bool" to return errors from ACPICA initialization

  Stop using GRUB error codes, since the error code never gets passed
  through GRUB.

  Also use the proper type to hold ACPICA error codes.

- efi: Add network-related protocol GUIDs

- efi: Add EFI_PCI_IO_PROTOCOL and a simple test function

- Convert many modules to use "from __future__ import print_function".

- testmsr: Remove redundant output in MSR result descriptions

- Eliminate redundant acpica2.h header; move contents to acpica.h

- Delete unused header file misc.h

- NEWS.txt: Fix typos in release notes for bits-1151

bits-1151
=========

The "I FFI, UEFI, we all FFI for EFI" release.

BITS now supports making EFI calls via the Python ctypes module, rather than
manually using efi.call.  This provides simplified call syntax, type safety,
better (reference-counted) memory lifetime handling, bounds checking, and the
ability to have EFI call Python callbacks.

All EFI protocols, functions, and types have been converted to use ctypes.

This also provides automatic conversions to and from Python types as
appropriate.  For instance, functions declared to accept a c_wchar_p (a Unicode
string) accept Python string and unicode objects:

    out = efi.system_table.ConOut.contents
    out.OutputString(out, "Hello world!\r\n")

- Add support for the 64-bit EFI calling convention in ctypes

  Ship a separate copy of libffi with 64-bit EFI support added, and change
  Python's _ctypes module to support that calling convention.

  Add the uintptr_t and intptr_t types to our stdint.h, since libffi needs
  uintptr_t.

- Convert all EFI functions, structure, and protocols to ctypes

  Now that ctypes can call EFI functions, convert all functions to use it,
  along with the corresponding types and protocols.  This significantly
  improves type safety, memory lifetime handling, bounds checking, and
  similar.

  In particular, code should now almost never use from_address or
  addressof, since those produce raw addresses that may outlive the
  objects they point to; code using from_address should now use
  from_buffer or similar, and code using addressof should use byref or
  similar.

  Define a new type EFIFUNCTYPE, analogous to ctypes.CFUNCTYPE, for calls
  using the EFI calling convention.  For convenience, provide a wrapper
  efi.FUNC that assumes a return type of EFI_STATUS (overridable with a
  keyword parameter "ret").

  To simplify the process of translating EFI functions and structures from
  specifications, define appropriate EFI type aliases for ctypes types.
  For instance, EFI extensively uses the type UINTN for "an integer the
  size of a pointer", so the efi module defines that type as c_ulong.

  Using ctypes function types also enables many convenient conversions.
  For example, a function taking a parameter of type c_wchar_p can accept
  a Python string or unicode object.  See the ctypes documentation for
  more details.

  When defining function parameter and return types, note that the ctypes
  types c_char_p and c_wchar_p have additional magic behavior above and
  beyond a normal pointer, to transparently accept and return strings.
  This behavior can be convenient, but it means that an EFI function
  specified to accept or return a pointer to CHAR16 may want to use either
  POINTER(CHAR16) or EFI_STRING (AKA c_wchar_p) as its type, depending on
  the desired semantic behavior.  Use POINTER(CHAR16) (and
  create_unicode_buffer) for a pointer that EFI will fill in (since
  passing a temporary object converted from a Python unicode object would
  not produce useful results), or for a returned pointer that the caller
  must free via the EFI FreePool or similar (since the automatic
  conversion of return types from c_wchar_p to a Python unicode object
  would discard the pointer that needs freeing).

  EFIException now decodes known EFI error codes as symbolic names, in
  addition to showing the hex value of all error codes.

  Since efi now makes much more extensive use of ctypes types, switch from
  "import ctypes" to "from ctypes import *".  Similarly, bits.present does
  "from efi import *" to get the EFI types.  In general, modules that just
  call efi functions should "import efi", but modules defining new EFI
  protocols or structures should "from efi import *".

  efi.call, and the associated split64() magic for 64-bit parameters on
  32-bit EFI, are no more.  They will not be mourned.

- Backport a grub change to fix a build failure on systems with new flex

  With current versions of flex, grub failed to build with this error:

  grub_script.yy.c:2367:13: error: 'yy_fatal_error' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
   static void yy_fatal_error (yyconst char* msg , yyscan_t yyscanner)

  Fix that by backporting the change from git commit
  9cc836a27be4a95f6f7bfd5b6bc099801645c0ea to disable additional warnings
  for the flex-generated lexer.

- Disable -Wunused-value for Python

  Current Python on current GCC generates a -Wunused-value warning on uses
  of the PyObject_INIT macro, because it expands to a comma expression
  where the rightmost value goes unused if nothing looks at the return
  value.  This warning turns into an error because of -Werror.

bits-1146
=========

The "EFI, FFI, fo, fum" release.

BITS now uses the Python ctypes module to access many types of data
structures and tables in memory, not just EFI.  The ctypes module now
works for non-EFI builds, so modules such as acpi and pirtable can
safely use it.  This required modifications to Python's libffi and
ctypes modules, to handle the various required calling conventions.  See
the new bits.cdata module for ctypes wrappers that provide improved
printing, formatting, bitfield handling, and types such as GUIDs.

Much of acpi, pirtable, mptable, and smbios now use ctypes instead of
custom unpacking routines based on the struct module.  Several new
internal C routines provide access to data structures as addresses
rather than Python strings, for direct access via ctypes.  Further
conversion to ctypes will allow significant reduction in C code in favor
of Python.

Thanks to many new optimizations, BITS 1146 starts up several times
faster than previous releases:

- The filesystem API layer for Python code now has a faster
  implementation of stat(), reducing the cases where it needs to
  enumerate the parent directory to find the appropriate directory
  entry.

- The Python pydoc module (with its various dependencies) now loads
  on-demand when first invoked via help() or the pydoc command.

- Python now supports the zipimport module, and loads the Python
  standard library from a zipfile.

Other changes in this release:

- Update Python to 2.7.9. Drop changes merged upstream, and add new
  stubs and compatibility APIs for functions now called by 2.7.9.

- Update to ACPICA version 20141107

- Support the Python shlex module

- The pager now supports saving the currently displayed data to a file
  on disk.  Since this requires file write support, it only works when
  booted via EFI.

- Print a message when starting BITS and when loading and initializing
  early Python modules, to help debug BITS startup and provide an
  indication of progress.

- smbios: Decode many additional structure types, and add a preliminary
  Annex A conformance test.  Includes contributions by Cathy Ji.

- efi: Add constants, structures, and helper functions for HII
  configuration protocols.

- efi: The efi_file class now provides context manager support, to work
  with the "with" statement.

- efi: Add menu entries to save and print EFI tables, in both raw and
  decoded form. Includes the System Table, Configuration Table, Runtime
  Services. and Boot Services. Decoded versions include names for known
  GUIDs in Configuration table entries.

- acpi: Optionally allow I/O port access from ACPI method evaluation. By
  default, ACPI method evaluation still ignores attempts to read or
  write I/O ports. However, acpi.evaluate now accepts a keyword argument
  unsafe_io=True to explicitly allow I/O. Also add a new debug printf to
  show attempts to access I/O ports; add "acpica_io" to the debug
  environment variable to see those attempts.

- acpi: When running under EFI, support saving ACPI tables to disk as
  separate files, both raw and optionally decoded.

- acpi: Generate the table-dumping menu items from Python.

- acpi: Support dumping decoded ACPI tables to the BITS log.

- acpi: Add a new load_table method to load an SSDT table binary into
  the ACPI namespace. Usage: acpi.load_table(table_data), where
  table_data is a string buffer of the SSDT's AML. The contents of the
  SSDT can be used to either patch existing or add new ACPI methods or
  data for debug purposes. Given a binary AML file stored on the BITS
  boot media as /ssdt.aml: acpi.load_table(open("/ssdt.aml").read())

- acpi: get_objpaths, display_objects, and dump now support limiting
  maximum object depth, with a new optional depth parameter.

- acpica: Provide more logging and debugging functions, to help debug
  internal ACPICA failures.

- _acpi: Add internal functions to get and set AcpiGbl_EnableAmlDebugObject

- init.cfg: Add a commented example to enable verbose logging from
  Python; useful to debug Python module loading.

Bugfixes:

- acpi: Fix double-free in _eval error path when processing packages

- acpi: Handle package arguments correctly in acpi.evaluate.
  acpi.evaluate attempted to convert tuples to ACPI packages, but did
  not recursively convert the objects in the tuple to ACPI objects, so
  any attempt to pass a non-empty tuple as an argument failed.  Fix by
  recursively calling _acpi_object_from_python on each component of the
  tuple.

- acpi: Handle CPU paths and Device paths separately.  Evaluate the
  former to get a ProcID, and call ._UID on the latter to get a UID;
  don't do both on both.  Make display handle processors with UIDs
  correctly, and format them correctly.

- acpimodule.c: Fix unused parameter warnings

  Previously hidden by lax warning flags that ACPICA requires; this will
  allow re-enabling that warning via GCC pragmas.

- efi: import efi from generated menu entries; avoid assuming that some
  other global Python code has already imported efi.

- efi: Make EFI table saving more robust (and verbose). Add error
  handling for unusual boot scenarios in which the EFI boot filesystem
  does not match the GRUB root directory.

- Avoid printing spurious pre-import messages for efi modules when not
  on efi. Using try/except to catch ImportError didn't stop the initial
  message from printing. Check sys.platform instead.

- ttypager: When trying to import efi, only catch ImportError

- When viewing the log, don't write the log to the log

bits-1090

- Update to ACPICA version 20140325

- Backport GRUB2 commit 4e42521d8c9232b6ee9eac7d8b4945a7479de781 to preserve
  16-byte alignment of the stack on EFI calls

- python: Support the csv module

bits-1084
=========

- efi: Implement comparisons on GUIDs properly, including comparisons with
  UUIDs

  Fixes an exception in smbios and mptable on EFI systems when doing
  GUID lookups.

- mkpresent: Work around bug in pdftoppm with rotated PDFs

  If the generated image has width and height transposed, rerun pdftoppm
  with transposed input values.

bits-1081
=========

The "ctypes. ctypes run. run types run" release.

This release introduces preliminary support for the Python ctypes module
in EFI builds.  This includes the initial infrastructure to compile
libffi as part of BITS.

ctypes data types, ctypes structures, and read/write access to memory
work.  This replaces many uses of bits.memory, struct.pack,
struct.unpack, and the BITS unpack module.  In particular, the use of
ctypes data types and structures allows round-trip conversions from
structures in memory to Python data types and back, generally without
making copies.

This initial implementation provides enough support for all the data
structures in the efi module, which has now completely switched over to
ctypes-based data types and structures.

Notable limitations:
- No support for non-EFI builds yet, because GRUB uses stdcall and
  regparm=3 for PC BIOS builds, which libffi does not support on
  non-Windows systems.
- Function calls to EFI functions still require efi.call; the
  ctypes-based FFI does not yet work, as it does not understand the EFI
  calling convention.
- dlopen does not work, so there's no way to obtain pointers to existing
  C functions to call.

Note that to support this change, the version of Python built into BITS
now internally uses UTF-16 (2-byte characters) rather than UCS-4 (4-byte
characters), to match EFI.  This allows the use of the ctypes functions
for the C wchar_t type, rather than hand-rolled functions for two-byte
Unicode.  Python still has full support for all of Unicode, including
characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane; this just changes the
internal representation.  However, attempting to use characters outside
the BMP in EFI calls may or may not work, depending on your firmware;
your mileage may vary.

This release also introduces support for reading and writing files using
EFI.  On EFI systems, BITS now has full support for writing arbitrary
files to a FAT filesystem.  The new efi.get_boot_fs() function will
retrieve the filesystem BITS booted from, as an efi_file, a new Python
file-like object.  In addition to the usual file methods, an efi_file
provides methods to open and create files and directories.  For example:

    import efi
    root = efi.get_boot_fs()
    newdir = root.mkdir("newdir")
    newfile = newdir.create("newfile")
    newfile.write("Hello world!\n")

Or, chaining the calls together (convenient for command-line usage):

    efi.get_boot_fs().mkdir("newdir").create("newfile").write(data)

The new functions `acpi.efi_save_tables()` and `efi.save_tables()` use
this new filesystem write capability to save copies of ACPI and EFI
tables, for later inspection.

Note that EFI firmware typically only supports FAT filesystems, not
iso9660 (the filesystem used on optical media).  The BITS .iso images,
even when imaged to a USB disk, keep most of their files in an iso9660
filesystem, with the exception of a small FAT filesystem used to store
GRUB itself as an EFI binary.  Thus, get_boot_fs() will not produce the
expected results when booting from an optical disc or from a disk
created from a BITS .iso; for full read/write support, create a
FAT-based BITS disk, following the procedure in INSTALL.txt.

This release adds support for many new EFI protocols:

- efi: Add read/write file support using FileProtocol, including a
  file-like object

  The efi_file wrapper includes the standard Python file-like methods
  (read, write, seek, tell, close, flush), EFI-specific properties
  (file_info, file_system_info, volume_label) and methods (delete), and
  methods to create or open another efi_file relative to a directory
  (open, create, mkdir).

  Also add a definition of the EFI SimpleFileSystemProtocol to open a
  block device, with a "root" property to get the root directory as an
  efi_file.

  Add a get_boot_fs() function to return the filesystem BITS booted
  from, obtained via the DeviceHandle of the LoadedImageProtocol on the
  image handle.  Useful as the root for writing files.

- efi: Add DevicePathProtocol and DevicePathToTextProtocol

  DevicePathToTextProtocol includes helpers to transform the returned
  paths into Python unicode strings, and then free the original memory.

- efi: Add LoadedImageProtocol

Other changes in this release:

- python: Support the zlib module

- bits.present, mkpresent: Use zlib to compress and decompress slide images

  Provides an order of magnitude improvement to disk usage and load time.

- acpi: Add an efi_save_tables utility function to save ACPI tables to files

  As the name suggests, this function only works on EFI, since it uses the
  EFI file write support.

  In addition to the binary dumps, this also includes text decodes of
  selected structures, and enough address information to recreate the
  tables in memory.

- efi: Add a function efi.save_tables() to save the core EFI tables to files

- efi: As a workaround for limitations in the internal EFI function call
  interface, add a compatibility layer for 64-bit arguments on 32-bit
  platforms.  Wrap 64-bit arguments in efi.split64(), and they will
  automatically be split into pairs of 32-bit arguments on 32-bit
  platforms, for compatibility with the current efi.call interface.

- Add EFI tests.  The first round of tests verifies the CRCs of the core
  EFI tables.

- efi: Add a base class for EFI protocols

  Protocols are ctypes structures with an associated GUID; they provide
  a .from_handle classmethod to get the protocol from an EFI handle (via
  OpenProtocol) and wrap it in the protocol class.

- efi: Add more known UUIDs

- efi: When printing structures, format pointers and unsigned types as
  hex, and list out the contents of arrays.

- efi: Various new helper functions:
  - Add a helper function check_status to throw an exception for !=
    EFI_SUCCESS
  - Add a helper check_error_value to handle non-status return values.
    Some EFI functions return a non-status return value, but still use
    the EFI_ERROR bit to indicate an error.  Add a helper that checks
    only that bit, and otherwise returns the value for subsequent use.
  - Add a locate_handles helper to call LocateHandle with a given GUID.
    This helper handles the two-pass memory allocation, and returns a
    ctypes array of handles.
  - Add helper functions to compute table CRC32 values.  These compute
    the CRC32 as if the table's CRC32 field is 0, and then compare the
    result to the table's actual CRC32 field.
  - Add a helper function efi.to_bytes to convert a ctypes structure to
    raw bytes

- README.Developers.txt: Document Python patches for ctypes and libffi

bits-1048
=========

This release introduces a new bits.* Python module namespace for new modules,
to keep the module namespace more contained:

- python: Move bits to bits/__init__.py to allow modules under bits.*

- python: Split pyfs functions out of bits into their own module, bits.pyfs

- python: Split pause() into a separate bits.pause module to avoid a circular
  reference

  bits imported redirect for redirect.nolog(), for use in pause(), and
  redirect imports bits, creating a circular reference.  Split pause()
  into its own module, bits.pause, to break that cycle.

- Add new bits.pirtable module to find, parse, and test the PCI Interrupt
  Routing ($PIR) table

Other changes in this release:

- Add bits.present, a module for giving a presentation using EFI GOP

- Add mkpresent, a script to generate slide images for bits.present

- readline: Add a mechanism to hook function keys and call arbitrary functions

- build: Support building local files into the .iso

  Useful for local testing; avoids the need to construct and subsequently
  modify a writable USB disk.

- mptable: Support finding the MP Table on EFI via configuration table GUID

- smbios: Support finding the SMBIOS tables on EFI via configuration table GUID

- efi: Add known UUIDs for various protocols

- efi: Create named constants for known UUIDs

- efi: Add function to dump all protocols in use, using LocateHandleBuffer and
  ProtocolsPerHandle

- acpi: Handle "local reference" objects

- acpi: Add test for parsing MPST

- mptable: Validate header length and checksum after finding an _MP_ signature

  If the length isn't valid or the checksum doesn't match, keep searching.

- acpi: When displaying the RSDT or XSDT, decode the name of each table

  A list of table pointers is...uninformative.

- acpi: Add a display_objects() function to show object types

  get_objpaths just retrieves all the object names; display_objects
  additionally shows the type of each object.

- ttypager: Add a context manager that sends all output through the pager

  This avoids the need to manually accumulate a string and call ttypager
  on it, and thus avoids creating duplicate versions of functions, one
  with the pager and one without.

  Note that all output is deferred until the context manager exits, and
  the context manager captures all exceptions and displays the traceback
  through the pager.

- acpi: Use the new ttypager context manager in display_resources

- ttypager: Make home and end keys move to beginning and end, respectively

- platform: Make cpuids and msrs iterable

  Walking them produces the list of all known (non-generic) CPUID and MSR
  decoded values.

- platform: Add a dump() function to show all CPUIDs and MSRs for all CPUs

- platform: Make platform.dump() display using the pager

- Add an explore menu option to show platform information via platform.dump()

- platformbase: Improve documentation printed with CPUID and MSR objects

  Show the APIC ID and docstring for CPUIDs and MSRs.

- platformbase: Add a sanity check to MSRs to prevent instantiating the generic
  MSR

  The MSR class requires an MSR number, and does not set that MSR number
  itself.  Subclasses that decode specific MSRs must set that MSR number.

- python: Stop using Python 2.7 {set} notation, for 2.6 syntax compatibility

  BITS is built using Python 2.7, but with this one change, the modules
  are parseable using the Python 2.6 ast module, useful for running
  analysis scripts from a host system.

Bugfixes:

- acpi: Fix structure alignment and padding for ObjectInfo on 64-bit

  ACPI_PNP_DEVICE_ID contains an integer followed by a pointer, so it has
  padding in the middle on 64-bit.  The containing structure has an 8-byte
  address which needs padding to an 8-byte boundary on 64-bit.  Handle
  both of those instances of padding.

- acpi.evaluate: Fix error handling when translating an object within a package

  When converting an ACPI object to a Python object, an unknown ACPI
  object type will set the Python exception and return NULL.  However,
  when that error occurred within a package, the caller would then add
  that NULL to the package and continue, rather than propagating the
  error.  Fix the package-handling code to reclaim the tuple and propagate
  the error further up.

- acpi: Fix unpacking of object info structure

  Invalid strings still have both a length and offset to unpack, even
  though the length is 0.

- python: redirect: Drop unused import of acpi

- testacpi: Fix typo in a test description

- python/msrs.py: Fix typo in an MSR name

bits-1007
=========

The "64 bits ought to be enough for anyone" release.

Add initial support for 64-bit EFI.  A BITS .iso image will now boot as
either a disk image or CD image for any of 32-bit BIOS, 32-bit EFI, or
64-bit EFI.  For updated installation procedures, see INSTALL.txt.

Add a GRUB patch to 16-byte align the stack for grub_main().  The x86-64
ABI requires a 16-byte-aligned stack, which GRUB did not provide.  That
caused some crashes, notably when running some SSE instructions.  Fix by
aligning the stack in assembly before calling grub_main().

Port SMP support to support running processors in 64-bit mode:

- Add CPU bringup code for 64-bit long mode.  Port all remaining
  assembly to 64-bit, and to the 64-bit ABI.

- Since long mode requires paging, pass the page-table pointer from the
  BSP (as set up by the firmware) to the APs.  Note that the current
  approach to this will fail if the firmware relocates its page tables
  above 4GB after its initial page table setup.  Also note that since
  all memory requires mapping via the page table, accessing memory not
  mapped by the BSP page table (such as a wild pointer supplied by a
  firmware structure or an adventurous tester) will trigger an unhandled
  page fault and unceremoniously die.

- Increase the size of the SMP working memory to accomodate larger
  data structures.

- Use a relative offset in the GPF handler, not an absolute offset; that
  avoids the need for a 64-bit offset.

- Port IDT parsing and setup from assembly to C.

- Port many assembly functions to use inline assembly, eliminating their
  calling-convention-specific prologue and epilogue code, to simplify
  the 64-bit port, and make the assembly more maintainable (by having
  less of it):
  - cpuid
  - pause
  - I/O port read/write
  - rdtsc
  - cli and sti
  - rdmsr
  - wrmsr
  - infinite loop
  - lidt and sidt
  - getting CS
  - drop_ap_lock

- smp: Delete several bits of old unused code:
  - Unused assembly functions
  - Unused data structures
  - Unused function prototypes
  - The "real-mode callback" mechanism, once used to park CPUs before
    booting an OS, but eliminated long ago by simply leaving the CPUs in
    an mwait loop in memory reserved from the OS.
  - A synchronization variable that the AP code no longer uses (a relic
    of waking the APs up via SIPI each time we have code to run, rather
    than waking them up once and putting them in an mwait loop waiting
    for work to do).
  - Code that allows the function called via SIPI to return, now unused
    because we call a function that waits forever for work to do.

Numerous cleanups to make C code 64-bit clean:

- Use pointer types rather than integral types when appropriate.

- Fix pointer-size and integer-size assumptions.

- Fix printf format strings.

- Make Python interface code 64-bit clean.  Use Py_BuildValue and
  PyArg_ParseTuple 'k' conversions for pointers.  Convert safely between
  some ACPI always-32-bit "pointers" and native pointers, with bounds
  checking.  Consistently use "unsigned long" for an integer of the same
  size as a pointer.

- Make various config defines and typedefs portable.

- Rewrite Python's file <-> fd mapping to support sizeof(int) != sizeof(FILE *)

  Abstract FILE * <-> integer fd conversions into functions to make them
  easier to replace and more maintainable.

- Handle overflow errors safely in fwrite()

- python: fdlibm: Explicitly define __LITTLE_ENDIAN

  fdlibm autodetected __LITTLE_ENDIAN based on some compiler definitions
  defined for 32-bit x86, but not for 64-bit x86.  Define it explicitly to
  bypass fdlibm's faulty autodetection.

Only one change to make the Python code 64-bit clean; thanks to the
wonders of a language with arbitrary-precision integers, the one and
only change involves parsing data structures supplied by the
(non-Python) firmware:

- efi: Parse the (completely undocumented) padding after
  FirmwareRevision in system table

Update boot support and documentation:

- INSTALL.txt: Update installation instructions for EFI support 

- build: Build and install EFI binaries

  grub-mkrescue already creates EFI binaries and embeds them in the El
  Torito disk image for the .iso; however, those are not easily accessible
  for use when creating a writable disk image, and they don't include all
  the necessary modules to support disks.  Build images with a more
  complete set of modules for disk support, and ship them in /efi/boot in
  the BITS binary distribution.

- Add support for booting BITS .iso files as EFI disk images, via an
  even more hybridized hybrid .iso format.

  Introduces a dependency on xorriso 1.3.0 or newer, and backports several
  grub-mkrescue changes from upstream GRUB.

- README.Developers.txt: Document that building the EFI image requires
  mtools (grub-mkrescue invokes mtools to construct the EFI El Torito
  disk image to embed in the .iso).  The previous release introduced
  this dependency but didn't document it.

Other changes in this release:

- _bits: Split out SMP and ACPI functions into separate _smp and _acpi
  modules, making it easier to do incremental ports of _bits.

- Move test verbosity level entirely to Python

  No tests use GRUB scripting anymore, so eliminate the test_verbose
  environment variable, and move the test verbosity level entirely inside
  the Python testsuite module.

- build: Enable parallel builds on all available CPUs

- efi: Expand variable-reading sample code to read and display variable values

  Uses both GetNextVariableName and GetVariable.

  Displays variable values as hex/ascii dumps, since they may (and usually
  do) contain non-ascii data, and the interpretation depends on the
  variable UUID and name.

- python: Implement assert() and make it actually assert.

  GRUB's assert prints a message on assertion failure but then returns.
  Abort instead.

  Also support capturing and printing the assert expression.

- smp: Verify that the SIPI target code fits in the region allocated for it

  The SIPI target code has to fit within the first 2k of the allocated
  SIPI target page, minus the size of the data structure passed to APs.
  Before expanding that code further, add a check to make sure it won't
  silently start conflicting with the data structure.

- python: Move all the C/POSIX compatibility functions from inlines in
  pyconfig.h to a separate source file

- testsuite: Remove the rdmem GRUB command

  No GRUB scripts use this functionality, and Python scripts have equivalent
  (and much more capable) functionality through bits functions.

- pstate: Handle processors without turbo when testing hardware P-states

- smilatency: Make the test variant that disables USB via BIOS handoff actually
  disable USB via BIOS handoff

bits-945
========

Add initial support for 32-bit EFI.

BITS now builds GRUB and the BITS-specific GRUB modules for Python,
ACPICA, SMP, and other support modules for both 32-bit BIOS (i386_pc)
and 32-bit EFI (i386_efi), and constructs a .iso which boots both ways.

The resulting .iso successfully boots as a CD using KVM with OVMF, and
still boots as either a CD or hard disk on BIOS-based systems.  Note
that the .iso does not support booting as a hard disk on EFI-based
systems.

On EFI platforms, Python's sys.platform now returns "BITS-EFI"; BIOS
platforms will continue to return "BITS".  (Future 64-bit EFI support
will also use "BITS-EFI"; use bits.ptrsize to find the native size of a
pointer, and use the "P" type with the struct or unpack modules to pack or
unpack a native-sized pointer.)

On EFI, ACPICA finds the RSDP as an EFI configuration table rather than
via memory search.

BITS now provides an "efi" module with some preliminary interfaces to
access EFI data structures and call EFI functions.  This module provides
all the functionality needed to find EFI interfaces by UUID and call
arbitrary EFI functions entirely from Python, without writing any new C
code.  For example, to print an iconic greeting:

    import bits, efi
    greeting = efi.encode_UCS2_mem("Hello world!\r\n")
    efi.call(efi.system_table.ConOut.OutputString,
             efi.system_table.ConOut._addr,
             bits.memory_addr(greeting))

The new efi module includes:

- The efi.call function seen above
- Helpers for buffer and UCS-2 Unicode string manipulation
- efi.system_table, a decoded version of the EFI system table and all
  the structures and interfaces nested within it, including
  BootServices, RuntimeServices, and ConIn/ConOut/StdErr.
- efi.print_variable_names, a larger code sample which demonstrates how
  to retrieve, decode, and print the list of EFI variables using
  GetNextVariableName
- efi.log_efi_info, a function now called at BITS init time to log basic
  information about the EFI firmware, including the firmware vendor, the
  firmware version, the UUIDs of supported configuration tables, and the
  corresponding names for any recognized UUIDs.

Expect the efi module interface to change in future versions as the
support for calling EFI functions and decoding EFI data structures
becomes simpler and easier to use.

Note that EFI's default text input API doesn't support returning
Ctrl-characters, making many common line-editing keys unavailable, and
making the essential Ctrl-D keystroke to exit Python impossible; BITS
now accepts Escape as an alternative to Ctrl-D.


Other supporting infrastructure leading to EFI support:

- bits: Add bits.ptrsize, which contains the machine's native pointer
  size (4 or 8)

- bits: Add bits.malloc to create a new buffer of a specified size

  Through the wonders of garbage collection, there is no corresponding
  bits.free.

- bits: Add a memmove function to manipulate memory directly

  Needed to write buffer manipulation functions in Python rather than in
  C.

- Add GRUB patch fixing EFI memory allocator page rounding

  The EFI memory allocator rounded allocation sizes up to 1k boundaries
  rather than 4k page boundaries.

- Add GRUB patch to support allocation below 1M in the EFI memory
  allocator

  Needed to allocate memory for an IPI handler.

- Add GRUB patch for EFI memory allocator memory type mapping

  EFI's AllocatePages call will refuse attempts to allocate memory and
  leave it marked as EfiConventionalMemory (free memory available for
  subsequent allocations), so map requests for GRUB_MEMORY_AVAILABLE
  into EfiLoaderCode rather than EfiConventionalMemory.

- smp: After attempting to allocate a page below 1M, verify its address

- smp: Allocate working memory with grub_memalign, not
  grub_mmap_malign_and_register

  On BIOS builds, the difference is harmless, but on EFI builds the
  latter calls the firmware's AllocatePages rather than using GRUB's
  internal memory allocator.  Since we don't need to reserve the working
  memory after OS boot, we don't need to use the firmware's memory
  allocator.

- smp: Handle systems where the BSP already has an IDTR

  On EFI, GRUB sets up a non-zero IDTR, rather than using the real-mode
  one IDTR at address 0.  Fix that code path to not attempt to "restore"
  to a real-mode IDTR.  Instead, save and restore the GPF handler in the
  existing IDTR around the function call in smp_function.

- smbios: Gracefully handle systems without SMBIOS tables

- mptable: Handle systems that don't have an EBDA

  On systems without an EBDA, the EBDA address in the BDA contains a 0;
  handle that rather than searching at 0.

- smp: Find the MADT using acpica rather than searching for the RSDP in
  memory

  In addition to eliminating duplicate code, this allows smp to work on
  EFI, which finds the RSDP as an EFI system table rather than through a
  memory search.

- readline: Add Escape as an alternate EOF character, for when Ctrl-D
  doesn't work

  EFI's default text input API doesn't support returning
  Ctrl-characters, making the essential Ctrl-D keystroke impossible; add
  Escape as an alternative.  Also improves compatibility with GRUB's own
  command line, which uses Escape to return to the menu.

Other improvements:

- README.Developers.txt: Document that the lnxboot partition number
  patch got merged upstream

  GRUB merged the patch in bzr revno 5185.

- mptable: Check for the MP Floating Pointer Structure in a
  non-spec-compliant location

  Some BIOSes put the MP Floating Pointer Structure in the 0xE0000
  block, rather than a spec-compliant location like the 0xF0000 block.
  Search that block to find the table in that block, and add a test that
  fails on such BIOSes.

- python: Split pyfs into a separate C module, _pyfs

- smbios: Add a blank line before printing the SMBIOS information to the
  log

- smbios: Wrap each SMBIOS structure when printing

Build system improvements:

- build: Build from copies of the source directories, not the originals

  The build procedures for GRUB and Python potentially leave byproducts
  in the source directories.  Rather than attempting to clean those up
  afterwards, build from copies of the source and leave the originals
  pristine.  This then removes the need to clean the source trees both
  before and after the builds.

  The build procedure now verifies at the beginning that the source
  directories appear pristine (no generated Makefile).

- Support out-of-tree GRUB builds: Use $(srcdir) or $(top_srcdir) as
  appropriate when constructing include paths.

- Configuring and building the same GRUB source tree for two different
  platforms fails without doing a clean in-between, so instead, do an
  out-of-tree configure and build for each platform.  (See below for
  many other build system improvements.)

- build: Set CCACHE_BASEDIR so ccache works on the temporary source
  copies

  Normally, ccache will never hit if the path to the source or include
  files changes; thus, copying all the source trees to a temporary
  directory makes ccache always miss.  Set CCACHE_BASEDIR to the root of
  that temporary directory, so that ccache can still hit if the
  remainder of the paths match.

- build: Copy grub modules manually rather than running grub-install

  Rather than running grub-install to copy grub modules, and mocking up
  all the other things it wants to do as no-ops, just copy the modules
  manually.

Bugfixes:

- acpi: Fix improper access to number_system_localities field which
  caused an exception.

- In generated menuentries, stop deleting modules after import.

- smp: Initialize working memory to 0

  smp_init added a magic signature to its working memory, and checked
  for that signature to see if it had already run; however, smp_init did
  not clear its working memory after allocating it.  On systems that
  don't clear RAM on reboot, smp_init would allocate its working memory
  at the same address each time, and would thus think it had initialized
  when it hadn't, causing Bad Things to happen.

  Fix by initializing working memory after allocation.

- acpica: Make acpica_init_state static

  Nothing outside of acpica.c accesses acpica_init_state, so make it
  static and drop it from acpica.h.

- bits: Make cpuid_result print all eight digits of its registers

  Format using #010x, since the 0x counts as part of the length.

- testacpi: Fix typo in _PSD test

bits-910
========

- acpi: Add decode for all resource descriptors from ACPI _CRS and _PRS
  methods.

- Add ability to discover, decode and display the MP Table.

- SMBIOS: Add SMBIOS decode and display to Explore menu.

- ttypager: ttypager can now detect redirect status and output to the
  log file.

  When redirect.log() is active, text sent to ttypager will be directed
  to the log file first and then metered to the screen with no further
  outputs to the log file. When redirect.nolog() is active, text sent to
  ttypager will be directed to the log file first and then ttypager will
  exit with no text sent to the screen.

  ttypager module's ttypager method has been modified to check whether
  redirect's log() or logonly() context managers are active and then to
  direct all cached output to the log before metering text to the
  screen. This allows ttypager to be used when the logonly() and log()
  conext managers are actively limiting outputs.

  The redirect module now has a module-level status indicating when the
  log(), logonly(), or nolog() context managers are active.

- acpi: Add get_object_info() to get information from an ACPI namespace
  object.

  acpi.get_object_info() accepts an ACPI namepath and returns decoded
  information using ACPICA's ACPIGetObjectInfo().

- acpi: Add decode for software licensing-related tables MSDM and SLIC

- menus: Discontinue deletion of imported Python modules used in menu
  entries.

  Deleting every module imported by Python menu entries impacts the
  interactive python interpreter environment.

  Only delete modules imported during BITS initialization, before the
  Python interpreter is available.

- bits: Modify pause() method to only print the "Press any key..."
  message to the screen.

- SMBIOS: Refactor SMBIOS class to move header fields into a separate
  class.

- Bugfixes:
  - Make CPU frequency detection fail gracefully in the absence of
    APERF/MPERF
  - Fix Python reference leaks caused by Py_BuildValue "O" on a
    referenced object.  Py_BuildValue's "O" type adds a reference to an
    object, while "N" expects an already-referenced object.  Fix memory
    leaks caused by using "O" on an object that already has a reference.
  - SMBIOS: Fix the type of enumerated_type in SystemEnclosure, which is
    a bitfield, not a string.
  - P-state test now uses the one detected processor when no APIC table
    exists.
  - Only check for Turbo if 2 or more P-states exist.
  - PSD test now uses the new ACPI _PSD class.

bits-893
========

- Port BITS to GRUB 2.00

  - Drop backported GRUB patches already included in 2.00.

  - Forward-port our remaining GRUB patches, fix some new bugs in 2.00,
    and update the patch list in README.Developers.txt accordingly.

  - Update the build process to support the new build system, based on
    autotools and autogen.

  - Since GRUB no longer waits for user input after running a menu entry
    unless an error occurred, add an explicit pause at the end of
    entries using the GRUB pager, and add support to our pager to not
    exit at the end of a file.  This has the added bonus of allowing
    backward scrolling after hitting the end of a file.

  - Update readline and the pager for changes to GRUB's input interface.
    Now supports reading keys and modifiers as a unit, avoiding
    potential race conditions when reading them separately.

  - Various updates to C code to adapt to new GRUB interfaces.

  - Fix ACPICA portability interface for changes to GRUB.

  - Fix some new warnings that GRUB now includes the flags for.

- Extensive additions, improvements, and bugfixes to the ACPI parsing
  infrastructure.  In particular:

  - Add method result parsing and corresponding classes

    In addition to cleaning up method handling, this paves the way for
    tests of methods, which the previous decode-print-and-throw-away
    approach did not support.

  - Automatically generate the menu of ACPI methods

  - Improve the Struct and Unpack infrastructure, and factor it out into
    a separate unpack module for use by other structures, such as
    SMBIOS.

  - Add a helper for unpacking a series of substructures

    Numerous tables follow the pattern of unpacking one of several
    possible substructure classes repeatedly until running out of data
    in the unpackable.  Capture that pattern in a helper function
    unpack_all.

  - Add parsing for the FACP

  - Handle SRAT subtables with "enabled" other than APIC and X2APIC
    affinity

  - Handle systems without an APIC

  - Fix wrapping of text before paging to avoid hitting 80th column

    GRUB automatically wraps text at the 80th column, and that automatic
    wrapping breaks the pager's count of lines.  However, acpi wrapped
    lines at 78 characters and used a two-space indent; thus, lines
    exactly 78 characters long, or with word lengths that resulted in a
    78-character line, would end up printing an 80th character and
    triggering GRUB's word-wrapping.  Fix by changing wrapping to 77
    characters.

- Many improvements to SMBIOS parsing and decoding; in particular:

  - Rewrite smbios to use unpack, and decode structures more thoroughly;
    includes contributions from Scott Lawson.

  - In type 0 (BIOS information), handle the minor version correctly

    The minor version in this structure represents the digits of a
    decimal value, so 34 means .34, 4 means .4, and 41 means .41, so
    comparing the numeric value of the minor version (for instance, >=
    4) does not work correctly.  Compare it as a string instead.

  - When dumping SMBIOS structures, dump the string table and its memory

    This helps when trying to hand-decode an unknown SMBIOS structure.

  - Decode several more SMBIOS structures, and handle parse failures
    more gracefully

    Previously, decode failures in any SMBIOS structure would result in
    a complete parse failure and no data.  Catch exceptions inside each
    structure parser, and preserve the fields decoded so far.

- Move line-wrapping into ttypager, and use the pager for more menu options

  SMBIOS, and miscellaneous ACPI bits, now use our pager rather than
  GRUB's pager.

- smp: Mark mp_worker as noreturn

  Triggers a warning with GCC 4.4.5 otherwise.

bits-862
========

The "A Complicated Parsing Interface (ACPI)" release

- Rewrite acpi module to use new unpacking, parsing, and classes

  This introduces a new data unpacking infrastructure and class, replacing
  most of the uses of namedtuple with something more extensible and
  flexible.  The new infrastructure handles nested tables and reused
  common structures much more cleanly, and automatically generates output
  code based on field-by-field formatting instructions.

  In the process, add support for several new ACPI tables, including the RSDP,
  RSDT, XSDT, _MAT, and FACS.  Also decode more fields of existing tables, and
  break out some flags fields into individual flags.

  Update init and testacpi to handle the changes to the acpi API.

  Most importantly, this new infrastructure makes it much easier to write tests
  based on the contents of ACPI tables.

- acpi.get_table: Support retrieving the RSDP, RSDT, and XSDT

  ACPICA's normal AcpiGetTable does not support retrieving these tables by
  signature.  Add C functions in _bits to retrieve them, and then hide the
  special-casing in a new Python implementation of get_table, so that
  acpi.get_table works transparently for these tables.

- Add new acpi.show_checksum function, to compute and display a table's
  checksum

- Make acpi.get_table's instance parameter default to 1

  The underlying AcpiGetTable method accepts either 0 or 1 to refer to the
  first instance, 2 for the second instance, and so on.  Using 0 seems
  inconsistent; let's embrace the 1-based ordering.

- acpi: Preserve linebreaks when wrapping, to improve formatting of tables

- Avoid returning duplicate signatures in acpi.get_table_list()

  acpi.get_table_list() returned one copy of a table signature for each
  instance of a table.  Return a sorted list of unique signatures instead.

- init: Make ACPI-related initialization more robust against exceptions

bits-849
========

- Add a top-level menu item to invoke the Python interactive interpreter

  This avoids the need to hit 'c' for a GRUB command line only to type
  "python".

- Prototype API for hierarchical CPU register decoding.

  This allows syntax like:
  platform.cpus[0].cpuids[0].max_leaf
  platform.cpus[0].cpuids[1].aes
  platform.cpus[0].msrs.IA32_APIC_BASE.x2apic_enable

  Infrastructure implemented by Burt Triplett and Josh Triplett.  CPUID
  register decoding implemented by Cathy Ji.

- readline: Implement Ctrl-O, to run a line and load the next line from history

  This makes it easy to re-run multi-line commands, with or without edits.

  Note that since the Python interactive interpreter requires a blank line
  after a multi-line block, the history will remember blank lines (though
  not multiple consecutive blank lines).

- Add a new generated menu of all ACPI table decoding options

  This new menu offers options to dump every table on the system
  (including multiple instances), and decode any that BITS knows how to
  decode.

  Refactor the ACPI menus to split out table decoding, method decoding,
  OS reporting, and the dump-everything option.

- Documentation updates:
  - Create a new Documentation directory in the source for more detailed
    documentation.  Ship that directory as /boot/Documentation on BITS
    images, as well.
  - README: Mention Documentation directory.
  - Add documentation on Python line-editing keybindings.
  - Add a top-level menu item to browse documentation.  Shows all files in
    the new Documentation directory, with their filenames and the title from
    their first line.
  - Split microcode documentation into a new Documentation/microcode.txt
  - Split reference-code documentation into a new
    Documentation/reference-code.txt
  - README: Move detailed dependency version info to README.Developers.txt.
    Just leave a simple list of dependencies and links in the credits of
    README.

bits-837
========

- Update to ACPICA version 20130517

- Update Python to 2.7.5

  Update pyconfig.h, handle new definitions for 32-bit and 64-bit sized
  integer types, and define EINTR (which Python will never receive but
  nonetheless expects a definition of).

- Python readline: write out full lines at a time rather than
  character-by-character

- Add a new Python "bitfields" module for bitfield manipulation

  Most Intel documentation references bitfields defined as [msb:lsb], or
  as [bit]; this module allows creating and extracting such fields without
  having to translate them to shifts and masks.

- Add processor socket/core/thread topology decode and display.  Contributed
  by Cathy Ji.

- Provide a more user-friendly exception when asking for a CPUID on a
  non-existent CPU

  Now raises a RuntimeError with a clear error message, rather than a
  TypeError complaining about the inability to *-splat out a None.

- bits.cpus(): Cache the list of CPUs

  bits.cpus() recomputed the list of CPUs every time, even though it never
  changed.  Cache it instead.  Particularly relevant for
  bits.bsp_apicid(), which calls bits.cpus() to produce the entire list
  only to return the zeroth element.

bits-829
========

The "lines and pages" release.

- Fix readline for the case of multiple terminals with different sizes

  In particular, this fixes readline when simultaneously outputting to an
  80x24 serial terminal and an 80x25 VGA terminal.

- readline: Add Ctrl-Z as an alternative EOF

  Useful both for users of Python on Windows and as a workaround for some
  systems which had trouble recognizing the Ctrl-D key combination.

- Sort and deduplicate readline completions

  Python's rlcompleter generates duplicate completions in arbitrary order,
  counting on readline to sort and deduplicate them.  Do so in rlcompleter
  instead.

- Support tab completion of expressions using subscripting with []

- When completing, sort completions starting with '_' last.

  The current completion display goes through completions sequentially,
  so sort _internal and especially __magic__ methods last.

- Rewrite pydoc's pager to work on a BITS terminal

  pydoc went through various contortions to detect a proper pager,
  including using the tempfile module (which BITS doesn't have) to create
  a temporary file that it didn't actually need.  Pull out its ttypager
  (which almost works as-is) and rework it to run on BITS terminals
  (plural), with a few enhancements for usability.

- Use the new ttypager to view logs, allowing page-up and quitting

  This one goes out to anyone who has ever viewed a huge logfile and ended
  up rebooting rather than paging through it all; we felt your pain.

- README.txt: Rewrap to 77 character columns to avoid triggering GRUB word wrap

- Use the new pager to show README.txt

bits-819
========

- Add a "python" command to invoke the Python interactive interpreter

  This will launch the normal Python REPL, making it possible to run
  multi-line commands, nested compound commands, and run expressions
  having both single and double quotes without worrying about GRUB
  quoting.  And there was much rejoicing.

- readline: Support the completer interface, and make tab complete

  Tab completes by default, without needing to explicitly bind it with
  something like readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete") (which is a
  no-op for compatibility).

  The completion interface currently cycles through possible completions,
  rather than listing possible completions.  The list behavior may become
  available as a configurable option in the future.

- Add the Python rlcompleter module, and use it by default.

  Note that rlcompleter will evaluate Python expressions as it completes
  them.  However, this matches the recent change to the defaults of
  upstream Python 3, which enables completion by default as well.

- readline: Signify EOF by returning an empty string, not by raising EOFError

  Python generates an EOF internally when the readline function returns an
  empty string.  This fixes the ability to exit.

- python: Define the builtin help() function.

- Support the Python math module

  This incorporates additional math functions from fdlibm, as well as
  some implementations supplied by Python.

- Add a new bits.pyfs_file class representing a StringIO-backed temporary file
  in the (python) filesystem.

- Port redirect to use the new pyfs_file abstraction

- testsuite: Simplify test config file generation, and only generate it once

  Previously, testsuite regenerated the config files after each call to
  add_test.

bits-807
========

- Support a configurable set of operations in batch mode

  The batch option in bits-cfg.txt now takes a list of keywords for
  different batch-mode operations.  "test" runs the full BITS testsuite as
  the previous batch mode did.  The new "acpi" and "smbios" keywords dump
  all structures of the corresponding type.

- Add a Python implementation of readline

  Implements most of the standard line-editing keybindings, as well as
  history, and a stub completer interface for compatibility with the
  Python readline module.

  Also add a new "pager" module with context managers to enable and
  disable the pager, needed as part of readline (which handles the
  characters<->screen mapping itself).

- Use the new Python readline as the default readline for raw_input()

  Note that Python will only invoke this readline from raw_input() if
  sys.stdin and sys.stdout refer to the screen directly.  By default, BITS
  captures stdout to the log, causing Python to ignore this readline and
  use its own, which does not support line editing, echo characters to
  the screen, or respond to the enter key (use ctrl-J).  To use this
  readline implementation, wrap the code invoking raw_input in a
  "with redirect.nolog():" context manager block.

- Include the Python debugger, pdb, and supporting modules bdb and cmd.

  Try using pdb.run("statement") or pdb.runeval("expression") from the
  command line.  If running as part of a function, pass globals=globals()
  and locals=locals() to use the current context rather than the default
  top-level context of the Python interpreter.

  You will need to wrap invocations of pdb in "with redirect.nolog():" to
  allow pdb to use readline.

- Add menu entry to dump all ACPI tables directly to the log

- Python API changes:

  - New context managers redirect.nolog(), redirect.logonly(), and
    redirect.log() to select whether output goes to the screen only, log only,
    or both.

    Sending output only to the log makes sense for large info dumps, such as
    decoding every structure of a certain type.  Sending output only to the
    screen makes sense for status and progress messages.

  - Add a bits.pyfs_add_static helper to simplify defining static files in the
    (python) filesystem.

    bits.pyfs_add allows adding arbitrary dynamically generated files, but
    the new pyfs_add_static simplifies the case where the file will never
    need to change, allowing the caller to supply the contents as a string,
    rather than a pair of callbacks.

- Update to ACPICA version 20130418

- Fix -Wmaybe-uninitialized warnings, which show up by default with newer
  versions of GCC, and which GRUB's use of -Werror turns into build failures.
  - Turn off -Wmaybe-uninitialized for Python
  - Backport upstream GRUB patch to avoid -Wmaybe-uninitialized warnings

- Fix a bug that broke batch mode.

bits-793
========

- Support decoding or dumping the ACPI MPST and PMTT tables

- Formatting fixes and cleanups for ACPI decoding

- Add internal function to dump all ACPI tables

bits-786
========

- Automatically configure and use a serial console if listed in the ACPI
  Serial Port Console Redirect (SPCR) table.

  This makes the serial console Just Work on many Intel BIOSes,
  including those used in many emulated Simics systems, avoiding the
  need to manually add serial configuration to one of the GRUB
  configuration files.  In addition, this makes it relatively easy to
  use a serial console with BITS in KVM, by supplying a manually
  constructed SPCR with -acpitable.

- Workaround a bug in syslinux 5 that prevented it from booting BITS.

  syslinux 5 through at least 5.10-pre2 fails to boot GRUB's lnxboot.img
  or any other Linux-kernel-like image that has 0 bytes of protected
  mode code.  Work around this by concatenating lnxboot.img and core.img
  rather than loading the latter as an initrd.

- Add decode and display for many more ACPI tables and MADT subtables:
  - Decode and display the DMAR, HPET, MADT, MCFG, MSCT, SLIT, SPCR, SRAT,
    and WDDT.
  - Decode several previously unhandled MADT subtables: I/O APIC, Interrupt
    Source Override, Non-maskable Interrupt Source (NMI), Local APIC NMI,
    and Local x2APIC NMI.
  - For several ACPI structures with enable/disable bits, support printing
    only enabled fields, to provide more relevant output with BIOSes that
    disable unused structures rather than omitting them.

- Fix GRUB's handling of the pager environment variable, to always enable
  the pager when setting pager=1 and disable it otherwise, rather than
  incrementing and decrementing an internal variable.  The existing
  behavior required two "set pager=0" to turn off after two "set pager=1",
  and effectively enabled the pager when running an unmatched "set
  pager=0" (since -1 is non-zero) and disabled it with a subsequent "set
  pager=1".

- Work around a bug in the Simics local APIC timer implementation

  In some Simics implementations of the local APIC timer, the current
  count would not stop at 0 in one-shot mode, but would instead wrap
  around to 0xFFFFFFFF and keep counting down.  Detect and work around
  that by also stopping when current count > initial count.

  Without the workaround, the timers used during the INIT/SIPI sequence
  would not detect completion unless they happened to see the point where
  the timer passed through 0.

- Update to ACPICA version 20130214.

- acpi: Handle processors encoded as Device objects rather than Processor
  objects; required for systems with more than 255 processors.

- When testing the _PSS, fail more gracefully if it doesn't exist at all

- Handle systems with up to 384 CPUs (increased from 256).

- Increase preallocated log file size to 512k

bits-767
========

- Update to ACPICA version 20120913.

bits-763
========

- Significantly speed up the BITS boot process, by pre-compiling Python
  code to bytecode.

  BITS previously spent most of its boot time parsing Python source
  files and compiling them to bytecode.  BITS now compiles its included
  version of Python for the host system at build time, and uses that to
  pre-compile all of its Python source files to bytecode.

  This speeds up BITS boot time by a factor of 10 or so: on fast systems
  boot time goes from seconds to near-instant, and on slow systems from
  minutes to seconds.

  Since the version of GRUB used by BITS doesn't support file
  modification times (mtime), our version of fstat always returns an
  mtime of 0, so the build process patches the mtimes stored in the
  bytecode files to 0 as well.  Unfortunately, this defeats the usual
  Python mechanism to check for up-to-date bytecode, so anyone modifying
  Python scripts directly on the BITS boot media will need to remove the
  corresponding .pyc files.  However, the recommended procedure of
  modifying Python files in the BITS source tree and using ./build and
  ./mkdisk will still work.

- Update to ACPICA version 20120620.

- Update to Python 2.7.3.

- Port the SMI latency test from C to Python.

- Add a variant of SMI latency test with USB disabled.

- Now that all tests have moved over to Python, remove the C test
  infrastructure.

- Remove the unused C implementation of cpu_freq, previously ported to
  Python.

- Remove the auto-generated list of C-based GRUB commands provided in
  the menu and the README.  As functionality has moved from C to Python,
  this list has become shorter and less useful, and it doesn't
  substitute for real documentation.

- Improve test log formatting.

- Bugfixes:
  - Fix the return value of fread.
  - Fix fgetc to not sign-extend characters 0x80 and above.

bits-750
========

- Add new Python interfaces to read and write memory.  The new bits.memory
  function returns a memory buffer as an object, usable with struct.unpack_from
  for reading and struct.pack_into for writing.  bits.memory_addr returns the
  address of a memory buffer.

- Add support for SMBIOS:
  - Print basic BIOS/system identification to the log.
  - Add an explore menu option to dump raw SMBIOS structures.
  - Preliminary API for decoding SMBIOS structures.

- Add the Python module uuid.

- Port hardware P-State tests to Python, and make them available on all Nehalem
  and newer CPUs.

- Add more P-state tests
  - No duplicate P-states
  - No duplicate frequencies
  - Sorted in descending order of power dissipation

- Add a runtime test for ACPI _PSS: transition to the target state and measure
  the CPU frequency.

- Add a Python function to get the current MWAIT state for a CPU; use it to
  save and restore MWAIT states around P-state tests that need to modify MWAIT
  to test turbo.
    
- Clean up test detail output logic and APIs.

  Make testsuite.test always return the test result as a bool, rather than
  using the return value to indicate whether the caller should print
  detail.  Simplify callers accordingly, now that they no longer need to
  check the test result separately.
    
  Instead, testsuite now remembers the result of the last test, and
  testsuite.print_detail checks verbosity and that last result, acting as
  a no-op if the test should not print detail.  This allows most callers
  to use print_detail unconditionally; callers only need to check the
  detail level (with the new testsuite.show_detail) if they want to avoid
  doing expensive computations to produce the detail text.
    
- README: Document backported Python patch, and document the remaining patches
  included in GRUB.

- Fix the GRUB distribution shipped with BITS to actually have the backported
  patches that README says it does.  This change allows BITS to compile with
  newer versions of GCC.

- Bugfixes and cleanups:
  - When printing a cpuid_result, show the registers in hex.
  - Fix output formatting to wrap each line of detail separately, to avoid
    breaking pre-formatted text such as tables.
  - Fix bclk computations in hardware Pstate test.
  - Factor out memory dumping function from acpi module into a new bits.dumpmem
    function for use elsewhere.

bits-730
========

- Add support for saving logs to disk.  
  - BITS boot media has a preallocated 128k file /boot/bits-log.txt, and BITS
    can overwrite this file with log data (filling the remainder with newlines
    for padding).
  - Show the BITS version at the start of the BITS log.
  - Show the BSP processor signature and detected CPU at the start of the BITS
    log.

- To support this new logging, BITS now has support for writing data to files.
  As long as the file already has the necessary disk blocks preallocated, BITS
  can overwrite the existing contents of the file.
    
- Add a fully automated batch mode, and a configuration file /boot/bits-cfg.txt
  with which to enable it.  In batch mode, BITS will automatically run all
  tests and save the log file without requiring any user interaction.

- Add support for C-state residency and USB handoff tests to all Nehalem and
  newer CPUs.
    
- Drop support for trying to take USB back from the BIOS.  It never works on
  any system, and some systems actually hang when trying.

- runppm: Add support for PPM RCM specification 12.3, with new error code for
  reporting unsupported processors.

- When a test throws an exception, print the traceback.  Together with logging
  support, this makes it much easier to debug tests.  (If you ever see such an
  exception in your test logs, please report it.)

- Add the Python module ConfigParser.

- Bugfixes and cleanups:
  - When showing CPU information, handle a missing MADT.
  - Read 3-byte PCI class codes via one 4-byte read rather than a 2-byte and
    1-byte read.
  - Handle systems with <255 PCIe busses, by getting start and end bus numbers from MCFG
  - Skip PCI busses where bus:0:0 does not look like a valid device.
  - Make MSR blacklists more consistent across CPUs, and add comments on more MSRs.
  - Support translating ACPICA objects of ACPI_TYPE_POWER to and from Python
  - Improve ACPI output formatting by wrapping lines.
  - Drop support for logging to an ACPI table for later retrieval by a booted
    OS.  Saving logs to disk makes this obsolete.

bits-707
========

- Update to ACPICA version 20120215.  Update for ACPICA API changes, new
  source files, and new source layout.

- Update MSR consistency blacklists to include MSRs related to Last
  Branch Records.

- runppm: Add support for PPM RCM specification 12.2, and support PPM
  RCM versions with major and minor revisions, so that runppm works with
  a range of possible versions rather than just one.

- Add an acpi.dumptable() function to dump ACPI tables in hex and ASCII.

- Bugfixes and cleanups:
  - Fix DMAR table parsing.
  - Clean up various ACPI structures to use classes based on namedtuple
    with built-in struct parsing information.
  - Remove doubled parenthesis in menuentry title for MCFG dump

bits-691
========

- Fix setting ACPI processor capabilities (via _OSC and _PDC), broken with the
  changes to bits.get_cpupaths in bits-688.

bits-688
========

- Test additions and improvements:
  - Add PSD (P-State Dependency) test for processors which require
    thread-specific scope for the domain.  This test currently only
    applies to Jaketown (SandyBridge-EP).
  - Add tests for _PSS (Pstates).
  - Modify the SMRR test to recognize and abort if model-specific SMRR
    registers are used.  The Intel Software Developer's Manual documents
    two sets of SMRR registers: the architectural IA32_SMRR_PHYS_BASE
    and IA32_SMRR_PHYS_MASK supported by all recent processors, which
    smrr_test can test for, and the older model-specific
    MSR_SMRR_PHYS_BASE and MSR_SMRR_PHYS_MASK, which smrr_test does not
    implement tests for.  The SMRR test now checks for the latter and
    stops the test early.

- Support "Run all tests" in submenus, and support tests which run in
  submenus but not from the top-level "Run all tests".  This allows the
  creation of special-purpose test groupings (potentially duplicating
  tests from elsewhere in BITS), such as for specific test checklists.

- Python API additions and improvements:
  - Add Python API to read and write IO ports.
  - Add Python API for 64-bit memory reads and writes.
  - Add methods to the acpi module to parse the _PSD, _PSS, and _CST
    tables.
  - testmsr functions now allow specifying highbit and lowbit rather
    than shift and mask, and adjust printed output accordingly.
  - Move the Python addr_alignment function to the bits module.

- Port more functionality to Python:
  - Port legacy PCI operations from C to Python using the new IO port
    API.
  - Port PCI Express operations from C to Python.
  - Port the format command to Python.  In the process, drop support for
    calling format without passing --dec or --hex, and drop support for
    hex numbers suffixed by 'h', since no callers used either of those
    features.

- Remove various C code that became unused with more ports from C to
  Python.

- Merge the "common" C code duplicated in multiple modules into the
  bitsutil module to share the same implementation.

- Drop support for faking 64-bit legacy PCI operations via two 32-bit
  operations.

- Bugfixes:
  - Fix the docstring for bits.writel to use "dword" rather than "long",
    for consistency with readl.
  - bits.socket_index should return None for the socket_index if the
    acpi_id input parameter is None.
  - bits.get_cpupaths no longer returns ACPI namepaths for disabled
    processors.  The ACPI namepaths for processors were already verified
    to have a status of enabled using ACPICA's AcpiGetObjectInfo().  But
    if the ACPI _STA() method does not exist (which is often the case
    for older BIOSes which populate processors in the _PR_ scope instead
    of the _SB_ scope), AcpiGetObjectInfo() returns a status of Present
    and Enabled.  Add an additional check to ensure that each processor
    has a valid ApicId or a valid UID in the MADT.  On systems without
    an MADT, bits.get_cpupaths just assumes that all CPUs are enabled.
  - Make the menu entry to run all tests run them in the same order they
    appear in the test menu, rather than in the arbitrary order of a
    Python hash.
  - When running all tests, only print submenu headings if they contain
    a test.
  - The Nehalem power management test needs testpci, so import it.

bits-642
========

- Fix MCFG-based PCI Express init to not fail on systems without MCFG.

bits-640
========

- The Python acpi.evaluate function can now call ACPI methods which take
  arguments.  The acpi module now provides unique Python types for each
  ACPI type, and maps between them for both arguments and return values.

- Dynamically generate the test menu from Python, and add infrastructure
  to register individual tests, including grouping tests into submenus.
  This eliminates the need to wire up each new test with a boilerplate
  GRUB cfg snippet.  More importantly, BITS now has a "Run all standard
  tests" option, which will run all tests except those which target
  non-standard system configurations or for which failures might require
  a reboot.

- Port the majority of BITS tests, commands, and infrastructure from
  GRUB config files and C functions to Python:
  - Port the acpi_terminate, msr_available, test_cpuid_consistent,
    test_msr and test_msr_consistency, test_pci, test_options, and
    test_summary commands to Python.
  - Simplify the msr_available command to drop support for the --cpu,
    $viewpoint, and non-quiet options, all unused in any test script.
  - Port the CPU-specific MSR consistency tests to Python.
  - Port the Nehalem and Sandy Bridge power management tests to Python.
  - Port the SMRR test to Python.
  - Nehalem and Sandy Bridge power management test suites.
  - Port CPU frequency detection and display from C to Python.
  - Delete the C versions of ACPI dissection routines, and the
    corresponding menu in the Explore menu, in favor of the Python
    versions.
  - The Python and C testsuite infrastructures now share verbosity level
    and test pass/fail counts via the environment, to allow incremental
    porting.  This will go away when the last of the C tests get ported
    to Python.
  - Drop all the corresponding commands and infrastructure from the
    testsuite and acpica modules.
  - Remove newly obsoleted GRUB cfg files, and remove much of the
    infrastructure for loading CPU-specific GRUB cfg files, since none
    will get reintroduced in the future.

- Update README.Developers.txt for the wonderful world of Python
  scripting.  In particular, document the most common places to hook in
  new code.

- Python API improvements:
  - Automatically export all environment variables set from Python (via
    os.putenv or os.environ), so that they'll remain present when
    descending to GRUB submenus.
  - The acpi module has started introducing better handling for parse
    errors, by throwing exceptions rather than just silently ignoring
    malformed tables and structures.
  - The acpi module now provides functions and types for parsing the
    MADT and MCFG tables, and the per-CPU _MAT structures.
  - Add an acpi.dump function for convenient command-line debugging.

- Use the MCFG table to initialize the PCI Express base address, so PCI
  Express works automatically on most systems without requiring
  CPU-specific initialization.

- Add support and tests for Jaketown:
  - MSR consistency test.
  - Power optimization profile tests.

- Improve Sandy Bridge MSR consistency blacklist, adding
  MSR_PKG_ENERGY_STATUS, MSR_PP0_ENERGY_STATUS, and MSR 613h.

- Update to ACPICA version 20111123.

- Support adding and removing ACPI _OSI interface strings from Python.
  Using that support, improve the ACPI OS emulation to support
  _OSI("Processor Device") when emulating current Windows or supporting
  all features.

- The explore menu now includes an option to decode and display the
  MCFG.

- Formatting improvements:
  - When printing additional details about a test, wrap and indent each
    line, so that the top-level test messages stand out as headings.
  - Formatting improvements to ACPI display routines and to the string
    representations of ACPI types.
  - Formatting improvements to the "cpu" command.

- Bugfixes:
  - Propagate the return value of Python-implemented GRUB commands back
    to GRUB, so that GRUB configuration files can use Python-implemented
    GRUB commands in conditionals.
  - GRUB commands accepting MSR numbers now produce an appropriate error
    when asking for an MSR number larger than 32 bits.
  - Fix acpi_os.cfg to import the acpi module before calling functions
    from it.
  - Fix memory leak of memory read results in testsuite module.  (Not
    normally relevant since GRUB doesn't normally unload modules or free
    memory before booting an OS.)

bits-574
========

- New Python functionality:
  - Add a usb module, with support for EHCI handoff and showing host
    controllers
  - Add a pci module, which currently supports probing for devices by
    classcode.
  - The bits module now has functions to read and write memory, as bytes,
    words, or dwords.
  - Preliminary support for reading from stdin from Python; sufficient to allow
    reading individual characters to implement prompts.
  - New bits.set_mwait function, to set the MWAIT state used internally by BITS
    to idle CPUs when not in use.
  - New bits.bclk function, returning the CPU bclk, which indicates the speed
    of the APIC timer.
  - bits.cpuid now returns a namedtuple, allowing access to the return value
    via named fields (.eax, .ebx, .ecx, .edx) as well as positionally.  Use
    this to clean up various other code.
  - In grubcmds, add support for registering GRUB commands together with an
    argparse argument parser.  This extracts the help text and synopsis, to
    make GRUB's "help" command work.

- Initialize Python and register Python GRUB commands before running other GRUB
  scripts.  This allows us to implement commands in Python that other GRUB
  scripts need.

- Port many GRUB commands from C to Python.  Shared state used by both C and
  Python commands now lives in GRUB environment variables; once all commands
  have migrated to Python, the environment variables will go away.
  - brandstring
  - cpu
  - cpu_sleep
  - cpuid32 (now computes and displays the common bits and common mask for each
    register, highlighting the differences between CPUs)
  - pci_read and pci_write
  - pcie_read and pcie_write
  - rdmsr (now computes and displays the common bits and common mask,
    highlighting the differences between CPUs)
  - set_mwait
  - timer
  - wrmsr

- Delete some unused GRUB commands:
  - test_msr_available
  - test_pci_consistency
  - test_pcie
  - testsuite (internal implementation detail)

- Add more Python modules from the standard library:
  - argparse
  - gettext
  - locale
  - textwrap
  - timeit

- Make C and Python testsuites share passed/failed counts via environment
  variables.  This allows incremental migration of test_* commands from C to
  Python.

- Redirect output from Python to a log before running other Python
  initialization, to capture any errors that might occur.

- Add some preliminary parsing for the ACPI MCFG table.  In the future, BITS
  will provide tests for MCFG, and will use it to obtain the PCIe base address.

- Updates to runppm:
  - Add new error code from PPM RCM v12.1 for reporting locked
    registers/interfaces.
  - Only print verbose information when the PPM RCM exits unsuccessfully.  When
    successful, shut up about it.
  - On Sandy Bridge family, don't try to use PPM reference code without a
    compiled copy of the PPM RCM available. The built-in PPM code only has full
    support for Nehalem family, and eventually the built-in code will go away
    entirely in favor of the standalone reference code.  We don't want to
    maintain the same reference code in two places.

- Fix warnings from GCC's new -Wunused-but-set-variable option in the RCM code,
  and backport upstream GRUB fixes for those warnings in the GRUB codebase.
  These warnings broke the BITS build with GCC 4.6 and newer.

- Update README.txt for changes to the top-level BITS menu options.

- Update README.Developers.txt with some guidelines for Python code.

- Build system fixes:
  - Fix name of source archive for fdlibm to use .tar.gz, not just .gz
  - Check for Python, fdlibm, and ACPICA before trying to build, rather than
    mysteriously failing later in the build process.

- Bugfixes:
  - Fix the docstring of bits.wrmsr to document the return value correctly.
  - Fix ACPI common prefix printing to not print {} at the end of one-CPU lists

bits-511
========

BITS now logs all of the output from Python-based tests to an in-memory log.
BITS has a new top-level menu "View and Save Log", from which you can review
the log, clear it, or save it as a new ACPI table with signature BITS.  Yes,
BITS has the ability to save log output now.  And there was much rejoicing.

The log includes all output generated from Python scripts in BITS.  It does not
include non-Python output.  Over time, as more of BITS migrates to Python, the
log will become more complete.

Saving the log will add a new ACPI table with signature BITS, which will exist
only until you next boot the system.  That table consists of an ACPI header
followed by the log file as plain text.  To access the log and save it to disk:

- Boot any OS which can write to disk.
- Dump the ACPI table with signature BITS to a file.
- Strip off the ACPI header (the first 36 bytes).

Under Linux, you can save the log data with dd as root:

    dd if=/sys/firmware/acpi/tables/BITS bs=1 skip=36 of=bits.log

BITS now implements a new GRUB device, (python), which can expose arbitrary
data from Python.  This allows any GRUB command which operates on files to
operate on arbitrary data provided by Python.  It's *almost* like having a
writable filesystem.  The new log mechanism uses this filesystem, exposing the
plain-text log as (python)/log and the version with an ACPI table header as
(python)/acpilog.  Other future possibilities include:

- Dynamic menus: configfile (python)/menu.cfg
- Dynamic initramfs: initrd (python)/initramfs.cpio

Python code can add new files to the filesystem via the new function
bits.pyfs_add.  Be creative!

Other changes in this release:

- Improve the ACPI processor display to show sockets and ACPI scopes.  This
  helps detect systems which do not properly group all the processors from a
  single socket in a common ACPI scope; this may become a test in future
  versions of BITS.

- Fix ACPI OS selection menu to use functions exposed from the acpi module and
  not the bits module

- Add the standard Python contextlib module.

- Compile Python's built-in modules with docstrings.  pydoc on built-in Python
  modules should now be more informative.

bits-499
========

- Support GRUB commands implemented in Python

- Provide a pydoc command

- Include pydoc's data directory, so pydoc works on keywords and topics, not
  just Python modules and functions

- Add more Python modules from the standard library:
  - atexit (functions not actually invoked yet, though)
  - formatter
  - getopt
  - logging (but not logging.config or logging.handlers, which want network
    sockets)

- Fix our implementation of the Python os module to re-export bits of os.path
  expected for compatibility

- Implement time.localtime and time.struct_time.  localtime uses CMOS time,
  since we don't have any time zone information available.

- Improvements to the Python acpi module:
  - Functions to list all available ACPI tables
  - Expose ACPI-related API from the acpi module, not the bits module
  - Parsing and output formatting improvements

- In the built-in _bits module, change all internal functions to have '_'
  prefixes, to hide them from the public bits module

- python testsuite: In generic MSR-handling code, handle GPF and avoid doing
  math on None

- Add a preliminary test to verify processor bus numbers from discovery
  algorithm against MSR if available

- Additions to MSR consistency blacklists for Sandy Bridge and Jaketown

bits-474
========

This release of BITS includes many more modules from the Python standard
library.  Working Python modules:

- abc
- array
- binascii
- bisect
- codecs, encodings, and the giant pile of encoding-specific modules
- collections
- copy
- copy_reg
- difflib
- dis
- dummy_thread
- errno
- fnmatch
- functools
- __future__
- genericpath
- heapq
- inspect
- itertools
- keyword
- linecache
- opcode
- operator
- os.path
- pkgutil
- posixpath
- pprint
- pydoc (Some features work, requires setting TERM=dumb to prevent it from
  attempting to exec a pager or create a temporary file.)
- repr
- re, sre, and family
- stat
- string
- StringIO and cStringIO
- strop
- token
- tokenize
- traceback
- types
- unittest
- UserDict
- warnings
- weakref

The os, time, and signal modules exist but consist mostly of stubs to make
other modules work; future versions of BITS will contain more complete versions
of these modules, but some features will never work in their entirety due to
lack of corresponding functionality in GRUB (fork, exec, threads, writable
files, signals...).  Note, though, that os.environ *does* work and can modify
the GRUB environment.

- Add a py_options command to set Python options (currently Py_VerboseFlag)
- Start moving some tests over to Python, including the MSR consistency test
- Support parsing and printing the ACPI DMAR table
- Decode ACPI tables into Python namedtuple instances rather than just tuples,
  so that they have field names.

- Update to ACPICA version 20110623.
- Update to Python 2.7.2

- Actually initialize the FPU with "finit", to get it into a sane state, rather
  than counting on the BIOS to leave it in such a state.

bits-438
========

- The BITS Python implementation now supports floating-point. BITS now
  incorporates fdlibm, the "Freely Distributable libm".

- After running the processor power-management reference code, BITS will now
  re-initialize ACPICA to make it aware of the new tables.

- The Python-based code for ACPI exploration (available via the explore menu)
  now includes many improvements to the ACPI decoding and display:
  - Provide an exploratory menu to allow changing the requested ACPI PPM
    features, to emulate different OSes.  The underlying functions now support
    setting the PPM capability flags via _PDC or _OSC.
  - Improve MADT parsing, and add support for x2APIC.  Support and display
    mappings between CPU paths, procid/UID, and APICID/x2APICID.
  - Support CPU detection in Python and provide CPU-specific modules.  Decode
    CPU-specific MWAIT hints.
  - Handle more quirks in ACPI decoding, such as methods which return 0 rather
    than an expected package, or methods which return NULL.
  - Handle CPUID leaf 0xB not existing.
  - Print a warning message for an empty _PSS.
  - Miscellaneous formatting and display improvements.

- Improvements to the built-in "bits" Python module:
  - Add support for cpuid, wrmsr, PCI, and PCIe
  - Support retrieving the BSP APIC ID
  - Improve exception handling, and use exceptions for more types of unexpected errors
  - Add an acpi_objpaths function to find arbitrary ACPI objects

- Add license header to Python modules

- rcm: Add and handle a new error code for new versions of the PPM reference
  code.

- NEWS.txt: Formatting fixes in bits-400 Python examples


bits-400
========

This release of BITS incorporates Python.  You can now run Python expressions
on the command line, and import Python modules from .py files in /boot/python.
As a demonstration, we have included a port of the ACPI exploratory menu to a
Python script.

You can run Python expressions from the BITS command line using the new "py"
command: py 'python expression'.  For example:

py 'print "Hello from Python!"'
    
To run larger quantities of Python code, put it in a module in the /boot/python
directory (included in the default module load path), and import it from a
Python expression.  For example:

py 'import acpi'
py 'acpi.display_pss()'

BITS provides a built-in module "bits" which includes some preliminary bindings
to existing BITS functionality; these bindings will expand significantly in
subsequent releases, to expose the full functionality currently exposed as GRUB
commands.  Some examples:

py 'import bits'
py 'print "TSC: 0x%x" % bits.rdmsr(0, 0x10)'
py 'print bits.acpi_eval("\\_PR_.CPU0._PSS")'
py 'print repr(bits.acpi_get_table("APIC"))'

We currently provide a few other built-in modules, including the "struct"
module for decoding more complex binary structures.  Future releases will
include more of the Python standard library as needed.

A few notable limitations:
- Floating-point functions will fail when called.
- Many file-related functions have limitations based on those of GRUB, and/or
  things we didn't feel like implementing (such as ungetc and reading from
  stdin).
- No dynamic loading of binary modules; only modules built-in at compile time,
  and Python source modules.

Other changes in this release:

- Bugfixes in the existing ACPI menuentries based on GRUB scripting.


bits-392
========

- Update to ACPICA version 20110413
    
- When displaying ACPI processor objects, look up and display the corresponding
  APIC ID from the MADT

- Support 8-byte PCIe reads and writes, by doing two 4-byte operations


bits-386
========

This release of BITS incorporates the full ACPICA runtime (http://acpica.org/),
and provides commands to decode power-management ACPI structures; see the new
"ACPI Exploration" menu under the Explore menu.

- Add a new module incorporating ACPICA, and ship an (unmodified) copy of
  ACPICA in the BITS distribution.

- Add commands to explore ACPI processors, P-states, C-states, and T-states:
  - PROCESSOR objects
  - _CSD (C-State Dependency)
  - _CST (C-States) 
  - _PCT (Performance Control)
  - _PDL (P-State Depth Limit) 
  - _PPC (Performance Present Capabilities) 
  - _PSD (P-State Dependency) 
  - _PSS (Performance Supported States)
  - _PTC (Processor Throttling Control)
  - _TDL (T-State Depth Limit) 
  - _TPC (Throttling Present Capabilities)
  - _TSD (T-State Dependency)
  - _TSS (Throttling Supported States)

- README.Developers.txt: Note that BITS requires tofrodos

- build: Copy the .iso to bits-latest.iso for convenience, like the .zip

- Move options to boot an MBR into a separate submenu, and move it lower

- Wordsmithing on menu entry titles


bits-372
========

- The BITS distribution now includes a bootable ISO image for convenience;
  thanks to deep magic in GRUB, this image also works as a bootable USB disk
  image.  This image lets you create bootable BITS media more quickly and
  easily, though the resulting media does not support subsequent modification.
  For more information, see INSTALL.txt.

- Add documentation in INSTALL.txt for upgrading an existing BITS USB disk by
  replacing the boot directory, without repeating the entire procedure for
  making the disk bootable.

- Note that building BITS from source now constructs an .iso image using
  grub-mkrescue, which requires xorriso.

- Correct the description of the new tests in the previous version of BITS.


bits-365
========

- New tests on the test menu, converted from exploratory options to pass/fail
  tests:
    - SMI latency test (requires less than 150 microseconds maximum latency)
    - C-state residency test (requires at least 85% residency for both core and
      package C-states)

- Change the default test verbosity level to show detailed information about
  failures.

- Split out and extend the MSR consistency test for Sandy Bridge EP

- Add a warning to the SMI test that touching the keyboard could affect the
  results

- Backported a GRUB2 fix making the pager environment variable work correctly
  (bzr revno 3106)

- Test command improvements:
    - Support --cpu in test_msr
    - Add a --quiet option to the cpu command
    - Improve documentation for cpu --env

- Fun and exciting hacks to make the test_verbose environment variable work
  properly when set from a submenu

- Various formatting and wordsmithing improvements to test text

bits-344
========

- Added a Test Verbose Level Menu to the Test Menu. Using this menu, test
  output can be changed to provide more or less detailed test results. The
  Test Verbose Level can also be modified via an the "test_verbose"
  environment variable. By default, Test Verbose forces minimal output
  including test strings for FAIL only and a summary including the total
  PASS and FAIL counts.

- Modified the P-state test to determine PASS / FAIL status for each ratio
  tested. Also moved the P-state test from the Explore menu to the Test
  menu.

- Modified the cpu_freq function to include a new command line option to
  prevent screen output (quiet mode) and another to force the measured and
  adjusted frequency values into environment variables.

- Corrected the SMP library to ignore the APIC delivery status bit in x2APIC
  mode.

- For Linux-based installations, INSTALL.txt now recommends using the MBR
  from the Syslinux package.

bits-332
========

- Update MSR Consistency tests to exclude additional MSRs which may be
  inconsistent but not indicate issues with BIOS initialization.

- Updated the test_options' command line help to include verbose level
  definitions and default value.

bits-329
========

- Fix a bug in the SMI Latency test which caused GPF reset when the SMI Count
  MSR is unsupported by the processor. Be sure SMI Count MSR read is only read
  via SMP function to ensure that GPF handling is performed.

bits-327
========

- Check MSR_SMI_COUNT (0x34) in the SMI test.

- Detect Intel Atom processors

- Add initial MSR consistency check for Atom

- Check package C2 residency on Sandy Bridge

- Use GRUB's "export" command to simplify use of common variables in many
  configuration scripts.

- Fix typo in install-mbr invocation in INSTALL.txt: it should use a disk
  device, not a partition device.  Thanks to "hans Bogert, van den" for the
  report.

- Ship COPYING in the boot/ directory of the .zip distribution, not just in the
  source code provided in boot/src/bits-*.tar.gz

- Fix script error that impacted availability of C-state residency tests on
  some systems.

bits-316
========

- Build process improvements, particularly for builds from release tarballs
  rather than from the git repository.

- Build with -fno-strict-aliasing; otherwise recent GCC warns about our various
  exciting pointer manipulations.

bits-310
========

- Documentation updates.

- Produce a GRUB tarball by hand, rather than using make dist.  In the GRUB
  snapshot we use (revno 2587), make dist omits various files essential to the
  build, such as util/import_gcry.py.  As a temporary workaround, generate the
  GRUB tarball by hand, by making maintainer-clean and then tarring up the GRUB
  source directory.

bits-307
========

- Add power management test suite for Sandy Bridge microarchitecture.

- Make build scripts do more autodetection to avoid hardcoding paths to the
  BITS source and GRUB2 source in $HOME.  Look for GRUB2 source at ../grub
  relative to the BITS source directory, and support specifying an explicit
  path via the grub_src environment variable.

- Ship NEWS.txt in the BITS distribution so it ends up on BITS boot media.

bits-300
========

- Change the syslinux configuration file to use the "append" command rather
  than the "initrd" command, for compatibility with syslinux releases older
  than 3.71.  Thanks to Darrick Wong for the report.

- Improvements to the Linux installation instructions for constructing a USB
  disk.


bits-295
========

- Initial public release of BITS.
